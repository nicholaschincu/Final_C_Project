# Final_C_Project - Project_Neptune
By Nicholas Chin and Hyungkyu Lee 

#Introduction
This project is to demonstrate the a model of our Solar System. We thought creating a program to visualize models would be greatly beneficial to learn for future reference and why not learn to do it c?
Our project will display the eight planets revolving around the sun using C lang., specifically ncurses that will visualize the planets and allow the planets to move around the sun. 

#Technical Description:
  First we defined the parameters of the project. By using math.h, we defined the period of each of the eight planets in our solar system and used sin, cos to make a circular revolution for the planets.
